3. The current and following boxes are EMPTY. The exact number of boxes to leave empty depends on how many fossils you want to revive in one go.
4. SAVE the game.
5. Start the program in the game.

## Options

### How Many Fossils to Revive Before Checking Them in Box

How many fossils to revive in one go before checking whether they are shiny and/or alpha in box. The more fossils you revive in one go, the more efficient the program is. Fossil shiny chance is not affected by the shiny charm. So we would want every little speed we can get.
