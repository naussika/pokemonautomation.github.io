### Box Setup

1. Both Switches have N boxes completely filled consecutively in the box system.
2. All Pokémon in these N boxes on both Switches must be tradable.


### Instructions

1. The two Switches are in a trade together.
2. Both Switches are on the first (left-most) box of the N boxes that they will exchange.
3. Start the program in the game.

The location of the cursor in the box does not matter. The program will read it and move it accordingly.

Once started, the program will swap all the Pokémon in the N boxes on the two Switches.

## Options

### Number of Boxes to Trade:
